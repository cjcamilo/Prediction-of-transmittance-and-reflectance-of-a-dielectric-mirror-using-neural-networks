# Prediction-of-transmittance-and-reflectance-of-a-dielectric-mirror-using-neural-networks
Code implementation of the neural networks used in this work. 

Every folder has a .ipynb archive named as Recurrent_#Layers which has the code of the neural network.
There are three files in each folder: matrix_SiO2.txt, matrix_ZnS.txt and a .dat archive. The .txt files have the information of the complex refractive indices of the materials corresponding to each wavelength. The .dat file has the information of the values of reflectance and trasmittance for each wavelength. In the second and third column are the pameters of the s-polarization and in the fourth and fifth colum are the values for p-polarization. Absorbance is considered
